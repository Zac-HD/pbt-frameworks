Overview of Property-Based Testing Functionality
================================================

Property-based testing (PBT) frameworks come with a number of
different features, but which library supports which features?
For a PBT newcomer, it can be hard to tell.
- To test an imperative API a framework with state machine support would be nice.
- Integrated shrinking can be a nice feature for bigger developments
  where writing custom shrinkers may be out of the question.
- ...

This overview is to help myself keep track. It has been compiled over a number of years
[teaching PBT](https://janmidtgaard.dk/quickcheck/). As features are gradually added to
a framework the table's entries may unfortunately become outdated. YMMV.

I'll be happy to accept PRs for updating entries and adding new frameworks.

**Legend:**
 - **Shrinking** denotes whether the framework has built-in support for reducing counterexamples.
 - **Integrated shrinking** denotes whether shrinkers "come for free" as part of the generators.
 - **State machine** denotes whether the framework has a state-machine library for model-based testing.
 - **Parallel state machine** denotes whether the framework supports parallel state-machine testing for race conditons, etc.



Background:
-----------

PBT was originally introduced in [*'QuickCheck: A Lightweight Tool for Random Testing of Haskell Programs'* by Claessen and Hughes (ICFP 2000)](http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/%7Erobby/courses/395-495-2009-fall/quick.pdf).


**Integrated shrinking** is explained in more detail in
 - [an early design thread on the Haskell mailing list](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2013-November/021674.html)
 - [a Reddit thread announcing Hedgehog](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/646k3d/ann_hedgehog_property_testing/)
 - [a talk by Jacob Stanley on Hedgehog's design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIv_9T0xKEo)
 - [a blog post by Edsko de Vries with pro/cons](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2019/05/integrated-shrinking/)
 - [McIver's Hypothesis article advocating the approach](https://hypothesis.works/articles/integrated-shrinking/)
 - [*'Test-Case Reduction via Test-Case Generation: Insights From the Hypothesis Reducer'* by MacIver and Donaldson (ECOOP 2020)](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/homepages/papers/pdfs/2020/ECOOP_Hypothesis.pdf)
 - [Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Test-Case Reduction, But Didnâ€™t Know to Ask](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/11/11/test-case-reduction/)


**State machines** to test protocols and systems with state are described in
 - [*'Testing reactive systems with GAST'* by Koopman and Plasmeijer (TFP 2003, revised 2005)](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/60573/60573.pdf?sequence=1) - which describes a model-based framework for Clean's Gast library
 - [*'Testing Telecoms Software with Quviq QuickCheck'* Arts, Hughes, and Johansson (Erlang 2006)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.6554&rep=rep1&type=pdf) - which describes Erlang's first `eqc_commands` module
 - [*'QuickCheck Testing for Fun and Profit'* by Hughes (PADL 2007)](https://people.inf.elte.hu/center/fulltext.pdf)  describes a later revision 
 - [the API documentation of Quviq's latest (commercial) version](http://quviq.com/documentation/eqc/)

**Parallel state-machine tests** for race conditions were later introduced in
 - [*'Finding Race Conditions in Erlang with QuickCheck and PULSE'* by Claessen et al. (ICFP 2009)](https://smallbone.se/papers/finding-race-conditions.pdf) -- along with a scheduler and a process visualizer
 - *'Testing Telecoms Software with Quviq QuickCheck'* by Hughes and Bolinder (Erlang 2011)
